# 🧠 Disease Prediction Model using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based model for predicting diseases based on patient data. Developed as part of my internship with **CodeAlpha**, this project uses classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of a disease based on input features.

## 🧪 Libraries Used

- **Pandas** – For data manipulation and analysis  
- **Scikit-learn** – For classification algorithms and model building  
- **Joblib** – For saving and loading trained models  
- **Imbalanced-learn** – For handling imbalanced datasets (e.g., `SMOTE`)

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/disease-prediction-ml.git
cd disease-prediction-ml
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Model
Ensure your dataset is in the correct format like the one in /content/sample.csv, then:

bash
Copy
Edit
python model.py
Optionally, run predictions using predict.py if available.

📁 Dataset Format
The sample dataset in content/sample.csv includes features such as:

Age, Blood Pressure, Symptoms, etc.

Last column is the label (e.g., Disease name or 0/1)

Let me know if you'd also like the following:
- A sample `requirements.txt`
- A badge-style header (e.g., Python version, License)
- GitHub Action or Colab badge

I can generate those for you too.
